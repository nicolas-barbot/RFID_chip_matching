Optimal Matching of UHF RFID chip

This script allows one to find the optimal antenna impedance to maximize the read range in free space. The principle relies on finding the optimal trade-off between the received power by the tag and modulated power sent to the reader. This matching is function of the tag sensitivity and states, and the transmitted power and sensitivity of the reader. Compared to classical conjugate impedance matching, we show that this new approach can increase the read range by 22% and 8% for a semi-passive tag based on Monza X8-K Dura chip and a passive tag based on Monza R6-P chip, respectively.

Special thanks

The authors would like to thank Chi Lun (Alan) MAK for his careful proofreading and his numerous comments. Alan succeeded to correct one typo in equation in the "B" parameter (see equation (19) in the conference paper and equation (22) in the journal paper) and several typos in Table III just before the publication in JRFID. Note that in Table III, $Z_{af}$ for the second subtable should be 18.7+j172 (instead of 17.8+j172).
